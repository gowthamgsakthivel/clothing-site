## ⚠️ Incomplete or Partially Implemented Features

### 1. **Missing Admin Panel**
- ❌ No dedicated admin dashboard
- ❌ No product management UI for admins
- ❌ No user management interface
- ❌ No contact message management/response system
- ⚠️ **Impact:** Contact messages saved to DB but no admin UI to view/respond

### 2. **Custom Design Flow Issues**
- ⚠️ **Unfinished:** Design conversion to final order
  - Quote accepted → Order creation flow unclear
  - File `/app/api/custom-design/convert-to-order` exists but may be incomplete
  - Missing: Payment completion handling after seller approval
  - Missing: Inventory creation for custom designs

### 3. **Email Service**
- ⚠️ **Partial:** Email configuration depends on environment variables
  - `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD` required
  - `ADMIN_EMAIL` must be configured
  - No error handling if email service is unavailable
  - Emails sent async (fire-and-forget), no retry mechanism

### 4. **Analytics Dashboard**
- ⚠️ **Limited Implementation**
  - Only custom design analytics exist
  - Missing: Overall sales analytics
  - Missing: User behavior tracking
  - Missing: Revenue metrics
  - Debug endpoint exists but needs production-ready UI

### 5. **User Profile Management**
- ⚠️ **Partial**
  - No dedicated profile page found
  - Addresses managed via API only
  - User preferences not fully implemented
  - No profile update UI visible

### 6. **Notifications**
- ⚠️ **Components Exist, Integration Unclear**
  - `UnifiedNotificationIcon.jsx` and `NotificationCenter.jsx` components exist
  - Missing: Push notification integration
  - Missing: Email notification templates for all events
  - Missing: In-app notification persistence

### 7. **Inventory Management for Custom Designs**
- ⚠️ **Incomplete**
  - No mechanism to create/deduct inventory for custom design orders
  - Stock updates may not happen when custom order is placed
  - Color variants management (see `inventoryUtils.js`) - basic but needs testing

### 8. **Size Guide**
- ✅ Component exists (`SizeGuideModal.jsx`, `SizeRecommendation.jsx`)
- ⚠️ But: Size recommendation logic simple, may need historical data for accuracy

---

## 🔴 Known Issues & Bugs

### 1. **Deprecated TypeScript Module Resolution**
- ⚠️ `tsconfig.json` using `moduleResolution: "node"` 
- TypeScript warning about deprecation (not critical but should add `"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"`)

### 2. **Duplicate About Page**
- ⚠️ Two about pages exist:
  - `/app/about/page.jsx` (current, simpler)
  - `/app/about/page_new.jsx` (newer, more detailed)
- Should consolidate to one

### 3. **Test Page in Production**
- 🔴 `/app/test-negotiation/page.jsx` exists in app
- **Issue:** Dev-only page accessible in production
- **Fix:** Should be behind admin/dev environment check or removed from production build

### 4. **Debug Routes Exposed**
- ⚠️ `/app/debug/` and `/api/debug/` routes exist
- `/api/analytics/debug` returns detailed system info
- These should be protected or removed in production

### 5. **Dummy Data Still in Use**
- ⚠️ `assets/assets.js` contains hardcoded test data
- Sample orders and users defined statically
- May cause confusion in production environment

## 📊 Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (context, components, API routes)
- ✅ Consistent error handling patterns
- ✅ Good use of TypeScript metadata types
- ✅ Proper validation in API routes
- ✅ Nice Tailwind CSS styling consistency
- ✅ Component composition and reusability
- ✅ API documentation through code structure

### Areas for Improvement
- ⚠️ No TypeScript for models (using plain JavaScript)
- ⚠️ Limited error boundaries in components
- ⚠️ Some components could be split (Navbar is likely large)
- ⚠️ Test coverage only on basic components/APIs
- ⚠️ No logging/monitoring system integrated
- ⚠️ API response structure not fully standardized

## 🎓 Conclusion

**Sparrow Sports** is a well-built, feature-rich e-commerce platform that demonstrates strong fundamentals in modern Next.js development. The custom design system with negotiation capabilities is particularly well-implemented and shows architectural sophistication.

**Ready for Beta:** With proper environment configuration and protection of dev routes, the application is suitable for beta testing.

**Before Production Release:** Need to complete admin dashboard, finish custom design order conversion, and implement proper error handling and logging.

**Technical Debt:** Minimal - mostly organizational (consolidating duplicate pages, cleaning up test routes).

---

**Recommended Release Timeline:**
- **2-3 weeks** → Production-ready with admin dashboard + custom design completion
- **Now** → Suitable for beta testing with family/friends
- **Immediate** → Remove test routes and debug endpoints from production builds
